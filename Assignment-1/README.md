# Assignment 1: Annotating Assembly Language

In this assignment we have to convert the given C code into assembly code and annotate the assembly code.

## Task 1: Convert C code to Assembly code

We have a C code named "asgn1.c"  
Run the following command to convert the given C code into x86 assembly code:

    cc -Wall -S asgn1.c

The above command will generate a file named "asgn1.s" which contains the assembly code.
