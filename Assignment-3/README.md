# Assignment 1: Lexer for tinyC

In this assignment we have to build a Lexer using flex for a subset of C language called tinyC. The grammar for tinyC is given in the problem statement of the Assignment. The input to the lexer is a file containing the tinyC code. The output of the lexer is a file containing the tokens generated by the lexer. The tokens are generated in the form of a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the token name and the lexeme. The tokens are generated in the order in which they appear in the input file.

## How to run the code

The code is written in C and uses flex for lexical analysis. The code is compiled using g compiler. The code is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04. The code can be run using the following commands:

```bash
make
